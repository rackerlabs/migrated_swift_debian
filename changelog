swift (1.5.0-1) lucid; urgency=low

  Note: This changelog entry includes information from the 1.4.9 series

  * New option to toggle SQLite database preallocation with account
    and container servers.

    IMPORTANT:
    The default for database preallocation is now off when before
    it was always on. This will affect performance on clusters that
    use standard drives with shared account, container, object
    servers. Such deployments will need to update their
    configurations to turn database preallocation back on (see
    account-server.conf-sample and container-server.conf.sample
    files).

    If you are using dedicated account and container servers with
    SSDs, you should defragment your file systems after upgrade and
    should notice dramatically less disk usage.

  * swift3 middleware removed and moved to http://github.com/fujita/swift3.
    This will require a config change in the proxy server and adds a new
    dependency for deployers using this middleware.

  * Moved proxy server logging to middleware. This requires a config change
    in the proxy server.

  * Added object versioning feature. (See docs for full description)

  * Add statsd logging throughout the system (beta, some event names may
    change)

  * Expanded swift-recon middleware support

  * The ring builder now supports as-unique-as-possible partition
    placement, unified balancing methods, and can work on more than one
    device at a time.

  * Numerous bug fixes to StaticWeb (previously unusable at scale).

  * Bug fixes to all middleware to allow passthrough requests under various
    conditions and to share pre-authed request code (which previously had
    differing behaviors and interaction bugs).

  * Bug fix to object expirer that could cause infinite looping.

  * Added optional delay to account reaping.

  * Async-pending write optimization.

  * Dispersion tools now support multiple auth versions

  * Updated man pages

  * Proxy server can now deny requests to particular hostnames

  * Updated docs for domain remap middleware

  * Updated docs for cname lookup middleware

  * Made swift CLI binary easier to wrap

  * Proxy will now also return X-Timestamp header

  * Added associated projects doc as a place to track ecosystem projects

  * end_marker made consistent across both object and container listings

  * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements
